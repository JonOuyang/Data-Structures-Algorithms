Stacks can Queues can be implemented using Arrays or linked lists. 

# Stacks
Stacks stack up, so the first one in is the last one out, and the last one in is the first one out. Think of it like a stack of donuts or rings on a spike. 

# Queues 
Queues are the opposite, so the first one in is the first one out. 

Both can be created using Arrays, Arraylists, linked lists, etc.
